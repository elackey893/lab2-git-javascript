[!WARNING] The Markdown listing what code fence close syntax like 
```
within a markdown file is a problem. Many Markdown parsers have 
like an extra backtick, but many don't. In this case I added a 
space that you'd need to remove! Remember sweat the details, and 
now there are sharp points and little gotchas all over the place.
